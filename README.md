<p align="left">Exploring the impact of unprompted AI assistance on human cognitive abilities and the implications for security critical tasks.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>

###

<p align="left">Our hypothesis is that unprompted assistance degrades the human cognitive thinking and disengages the human from their own critical thinking ability. In this project, we are studying and investigating the impact of unprompted assistance on human cognitive abilities. To test our hypothesis we are going to conduct an aptitude quiz among a group of students. This repository has the codes for the quiz application for all three scenarios that is proposed.<br><br>- No AI Assistance<br>- Prompted AI Assistance<br>- Unprompted AI Assistance</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Programming Language</h2>

###

<p align="left">Frontend: JavaScript (ReactJS)<br><br>Backend: Django + SQL<br><br>Tool: Visual Studio Code</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Requirements:</h2>

###

<p align="left">To run this code you'll need:<br>1) Python 3- Django<br>2) node (any version) and npm<br>3) ReactJS<br>4) Visual Studio Code</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Usage</h2>

###

<p align="left">Step-1: Clone the repo and pull the latest code<br><br>Step-2: To run the frontend code, first install all the dependencies using <br>'npm install'<br>This should be done for all the 3 applications.<br><br>Post that, give the below command to run the application on the browser.<br>'npm start'<br><br>Step-3: To run the backend scripts, first make sure you have python installed (any version) and install djano. Post that run this command to start the server<br>'python manage.py runserver'</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Functionality</h2>

###

<h3 align="left">Backend:</h3>

###

<p align="left">The backend folder has the code where all the questions and the respective solutions are stored in the database.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">Frontend</h3>

###

<p align="left">The frontend folder consists of three different quiz applications which will cover the three scenarios we need to conduct the experiment.<br>1) No AI Assistance (/quizapp-noAssistance)<br>2) Prompted Assistance (/quizapp-promptedAssistance)<br>3) Unprompted Assistance (/quizapp)</p>
